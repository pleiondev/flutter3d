## Unreleased

- **Accepted `flutter3d_geometry`, `flutter3d_formats` and `flutter3d_fbx`.**
  They are `package:flutter3d_core/geometry.dart` and
  `package:flutter3d_core/formats.dart` now, each importable on its own and
  both exported from `flutter3d_core.dart`; `FbxDecoder` is part of the formats
  library. All three were plain Dart with `vector_math` as their only
  third-party dependency and none was published, so the package boundary gave a
  caller that wanted a mesh or a `.glb` without the renderer nothing a library
  does not. Their tests, tools and skills moved with them; the skills are
  `flutter3d-core-geometry-meshes` and `flutter3d-core-formats-reading-models`.

## 0.1.0

- **The rendering core leaves `flutter3d` (`mcp-03n`).** Scene graph, render
  list, passes, materials and animation move here with no Flutter SDK
  behind them; `flutter3d` re-exports this package and keeps `rootBundle`,
  `dart:ui` and the widgets for its own thin shell.
