## 0.7.0

**Breaking.** Accepted `flutter3d_backend`, because most of its consumers
already reached it through this barrel rather than by naming it, and the
handful that still named it directly — two package examples, and one game's
now-redundant line — cost nothing to repoint, which left the separate
package with no boundary of its own (package-merge-plan.md §3.6). The
conditional export deciding which backend a
build draws through — `openDevice`, `kFixedResolution` — now lives directly
in this package's own `src/backend_native.dart`/`src/backend_web.dart`, and
this package depends directly on `flutter3d_hardware`, `flutter3d_impeller`,
`flutter3d_webgl`, `flutter3d_cpu` and `flutter3d_webgpu` instead of on
`flutter3d_backend`. Nothing an application imports changed.

## 0.6.0

* **Floors, and no code.** Storage, settings, the frame clock and the screens
  are byte for byte 0.5.0's. `flutter3d_backend`, `flutter3d_session` and
  `flutter3d_screens` move to `^0.6.0`; `pad_input` and `pointer_lock` stay at
  `^0.4.0`, which their 0.4.1 covers.
* **What arrives through the barrel is one line wider without this package
  changing.** `flutter3d_backend` 0.6.0 can try WebGPU on a web build given
  `--dart-define=FLUTTER3D_WEBGPU=true`; an application assembled from here
  gets that by raising the floor and nothing else, because `openDevice` was
  always the whole of the question this layer asks.

## 0.5.0

* No API change. Its floors move to the 0.5.0 packages it assembles.

## 0.4.0

* No changes of its own; the version moves with the workspace, whose sibling
  constraints name a single release. The README's closing section now says
  what the engine around this package is.

## 0.3.0

* A barrel over `flutter3d_backend`, `flutter3d_session`, `flutter3d_screens`,
  `pad_input` and `pointer_lock` — the five packages an application assembles
  itself from, none of which know about each other. No code of its own.
