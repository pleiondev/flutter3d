## 0.3.0

* The composite pass mirrors the grading, vignette, grain and dispersion the
  hardware backends apply, so the two reference sets stay comparable.
* Cube texture uploads validate each mip level's size rather than accepting
  anything that fits.

## 0.2.0

* `flutter3d_hardware` rasterised in Dart with no GPU under it: what the golden
  images are drawn with, and what a test renders a whole frame through.
* Deliberately shares nothing with either hardware backend — no driver, no
  shading language, no command buffer — which is what makes agreeing with them
  mean something.
